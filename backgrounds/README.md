## Design Features

The generated backgrounds feature:

- **Fluid glass aesthetic**: Translucent orbs and smooth gradients
- **Cool color palette**: Blues and grays that complement the theme
- **Subtle patterns**: Minimal geometric overlays for texture
- **Multiple resolutions**: Support for common display sizes
- **Optimized blur**: Designed to work well with Hyprland's blur effects

## Customization

To use your own backgrounds:

1. Replace the default files with your preferred images
2. Maintain the naming convention for automatic detection
3. Ensure images complement the glass aesthetic with cool tones
4. Use high-quality images that look good with blur effects

## Usage

The theme automatically uses these backgrounds. You can also:
- Use Omarchy's background rotation with `Super + Ctrl + Space`
- Set custom backgrounds in your Hyprland configuration
- Modify the hyprlock.conf to change lock screen backgrounds

For best results, use backgrounds that are minimalist and feature cool tones (blues, grays, whites) to maintain the fluid glass aesthetic.
